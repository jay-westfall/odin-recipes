    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Thanksgiving is just not Thanksgiving without a drizzle
        of gravy over your turkey, mashed potatoes, and stuffing.
    </p>
    <p>    
        Fortunately for you, I have the recipe for the perfect 
        gravy of umami goodness to tie together all of the yummy
        holiday foods. 
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp. butter</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup turkey pan drippings</li>
        <li>2 cup low-sodium chicken broth (or turkey stock)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp freshly minced thyme</li>
        <li>1 tsp freshly minced sage</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Whisk in flour and cook until golden, 1 minute, then whisk in pan drippings. (If you have more than a cup of drippings, use it and reduce the amount of broth!)</li>
        <li>Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer gently until slightly thickened. </li>
        <li>Stir in fresh herbs, then whisk in 1 cup broth and return mixture to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Simmer 10 minutes, gradually adding more broth if gravy is too thick. Adjust seasoning.</li>
    </ol>
